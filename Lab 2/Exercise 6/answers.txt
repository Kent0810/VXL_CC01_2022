Question 1: if in line 1 of the code above is miss, what happens after that and why?
-> Stuck at ON state because if no initial setTimer0(1000) so timer0_counter stuck at 0 and timer_run() executed every 10ms won't exectue the if statement 
-> timer0_flag never going to change to 1 
-> TogglePin will never be called

Question 2: if in line 1 of the code above is changed to setTimer0(1), what happens after
that and why?
-> Stuck at ON state because when setTimer0(1) timer0_counter = 1 / 10 = int(0.1) = 0 == 0;
-> Similar to Question 1
-> timer0_flag never going to change to 1 
-> TogglePin will never be called

Question 3:if in line 1 of the code above is changed to setTimer0(10), what is changed compared to 2 first questions and why?
-> On for 1ms then off for 2 second 
-> 10 / 10 = 1 > 0 -> if statement in Timerrun is active.
